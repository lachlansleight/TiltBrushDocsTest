# Welcome to some hypothetical Tilt Brush documentation

This site was built with [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/index.html).

By adding XML documentation to Tilt Brush code, classes, functions, properties etc. will gain automatic descriptions. e.g.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// This function does great things. Terrible, yes... but great.</summary>
/// </summary>
public void PurifyWizardingBlood() {
    //todo
}

```

In addition, we can write what docfx calls 'conceptual articles', which are more like tutorial writeups, concept overviews, guides, etc.
